## Data structures

### Data structures are ensembles of simple data types

* Vector (1-dim):
  + all elements have the same type
* Matrix (2-dim): 
  + all elements have the same type
* Data frame (2-dim):
  + each column can have a different data type
* Lists (2-dim), less used:
  + each column can have different data type
  + each column can have different length
